## Note from me ðŸ˜‹

Iâ€™ve tried my best to make the site responsive across different devices.  
I'm still learning web development, so please donâ€™t mind any mistakes.  
Feel free to drop suggestions or help out if you'd like!

You can contact me through the links available on my portfolio site.
